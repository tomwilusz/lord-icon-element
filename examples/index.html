                    This example presents the easiest way to use the Lordicon
                    custom element with released version. Keep in mind that this
                    is not the most efficient method as the entire library
                    (including bundled lottie-web) is loaded by default.

                    Use the target attribute to indicate which parent element
                    should activate the trigger. Helpful functionality when
                    building all kinds of links, buttons, or bounding boxes
                    where we don't want the user to have to mouse hover exactly
                    at the icon to activate it.

                    This example utilizes CSS variables to customize colors on
                    supported icons (at the moment only System icons). Notice:
                    CSS variables take precedence over colors assigned by other
